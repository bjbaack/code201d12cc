# Ops 201 Repository

## About This Repository

This repository contains scripts and solutions for the Ops 201 OPS challenges we faced during this course. It shows off the shell scripting and automations skills that were learned during this course. 

## Purpose of Learning These Skills

It is important to learn these skills because everything deals in code. If you can understand basic code it will help you go a long way in being more effective in your job. Also, many of the skills we learned in this course are routine tools that we can use to speed up some processes that may take longer without automation. 

## Fundamental Concepts Learned in Ops 201

During Ops 201, I gained a comprehensive understanding of key concepts, including scripting techniques, automation principles, virtual machine management, and cloud computing fundamentals.

## Favorite Ops Challenge Assignment

My favorite OPs challenge was using a loop to kill a PID. I think I like this most because it reminds me of control alt delete. Being able to get into the command line and see what programs are not only running, but to be able to kill them is very helpful. 

## Application to the Workplace

The examples of shell scripting in this repository show how automation can simplify tasks like file management and deployment, saving time and reducing errors. By automating these tasks, workplaces can boost efficiency and focus on more important projects.

## Scripts to Improve Further

I think all of the scripts coudl be refined, however getting more system information could be intersting. If you could pull what drivers are installed on certain hardware. 

## Areas for Improvement

I've gained valuable insights from Bash and PowerShell, but I'm eager to explore Python. Its versatility seems promising, and I believe mastering basic coding principles, especially loops, will be a solid foundation for diving deeper into Python eventually.
